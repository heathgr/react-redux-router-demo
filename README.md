Notes:

- I made use of React, Redux, and React Router.
- Most of my components are statless.  I rely on the state tree to determine how things render.
- I implemented state based routing by using the react-router-redux library.
- I used Redux Sagas to handle async actions with Redux.
- Styles where written using sass they are complied using node-sass.
- I used axios as my http client to fetch some data from the Yahoo Weather and IEX Trading apis.
